creating metal mask thresholding script:
    Key Findings:
  1. Adaptive thresholding works well - automatically adjusts threshold based on local
  image characteristics (3,000-13,564 HU range)
  2. Default morphology settings too aggressive - erosion radius of 1 eliminated all
  small metal objects
  3. Optimal settings for this data:
    - Simple threshold: 3000 HU
    - No morphological erosion (erosion_radius = 0)
    - Accept single pixel objects (min_size = 1)
    - Keep dilation for better coverage
  1. Created a metal mask thresholding script (metal_mask_threshold.py) specifically
   designed for multi-source array cone beam CT systems
  2. Built a data converter (convert_unc_data.py) to transform UNC binary test data into
   NIFTI format for processing
  3. Successfully tested the system on real RANDO phantom data:
    - Converted 480×480×120 CT volume from binary to NIFTI
    - Detected 6,850 metal voxels across 60+ slices
    - Identified metal artifacts with HU values up to 38,042
  4. Optimized parameters for your data:
    - 3000 HU threshold works well for metal detection
    - Disabled aggressive morphological filtering that was removing small metal objects
    - Validated both simple and adaptive thresholding methods

RANDO stands for Radiation ANalog DOsimetry.
It's a realistic human-shaped phantom made of materials that mimic human tissue densities in CT, MRI, and radiation interactions.
Often includes skeletal structures, lung cavities, and soft tissues with lifelike Hounsfield Units (HU).



extension to 3d:
Phase 1: Geometry & Data Pipeline (Foundation)

  1. Extend ray generation (utils.py:fan_beam_ray) to 3D cone-beam geometry
    - Add Z-axis detector positions and source trajectories
    - Implement cone-beam projection angles and detector arrays
  2. Modify data loading (dataset.py) for 3D volumes
    - Update TrainData to sample 3D rays through volume
    - Extend coordinate systems from (x,y) to (x,y,z)
  3. Add 3D forward model in projection simulation

  Phase 2: Network Architecture (Core Challenge)

  1. Input encoding enhancement - Critical for 3D scalability:
    - Increase hash grid resolution levels in config.json
    - Add Z-dimension to coordinate encoding
    - Consider hierarchical encoding for memory efficiency
  2. Network capacity scaling:
    - Increase MLP hidden layers/neurons for 3D representation
    - Implement progressive training (coarse→fine resolution)
    - Add memory checkpointing for large volumes

  Phase 3: Training & Loss Functions

  1. Extend EAS loss (model.py) for 3D consistency:
    - Add Z-axis smoothness regularization
    - Implement 3D neighborhood sampling
  2. Multi-scale training strategy:
    - Start with downsampled 3D volumes
    - Progressively increase resolution during training

  Phase 4: Memory Optimization (Critical)

  1. Implement volume chunking for large datasets
  2. Ray batching strategies for efficient 3D sampling
  3. Gradient accumulation to handle memory constraints

  Key Technical Challenges to Address:

  - Memory footprint: 3D volumes exponentially increase requirements
  - Ray sampling: Efficient 3D cone-beam ray generation
  - Network capacity: INR needs more parameters for 3D representation
  - Training stability: 3D convergence typically more challenging

  The authors suggest this is "easily" extensible, but the memory and computational
  scaling will be the primary engineering challenges for your multi-source array system.




1. Analyzed UNC test data structure - Found RANDO phantom CT volume (480×480×120) and
  projection data (360×744×229)
  2. Created data preparation pipeline (prepare_unc_data.py):
    - Converted 3D UNC volume to 2D slices for Polyner
    - Extracted metal-rich slices (55, 60, 65) from 120-slice volume
    - Resized images from 480×480 → 256×256 to match Polyner format
    - Converted HU values to linear attenuation coefficients
    - Extracted relevant projections from 3D cone-beam data
  3. Generated Polyner-compatible files in input_unc/:
    - gt_0.nii, gt_1.nii, gt_2.nii - Ground truth images
    - ma_sinogram_0.nii, etc. - Metal-affected sinograms (360×611)
    - mask_0.nii, etc. - Metal masks from our thresholding script
    - fanSensorPos.nii - Detector geometry
    - config_unc.json - UNC-specific configuration
  4. Validation - Verified dimensions and value ranges match original Polyner data
  format

  No images were output - The process prepared the data files but couldn't run the
  actual Polyner training due to missing CUDA/tinycudann dependencies on this system.

  Ready for training on a CUDA-capable system with the command: python main_unc.py

  The UNC test data is now fully prepared and formatted for the Polyner neural
  representation model.

  Steps:
  1. Upload the prepared data to Google Drive:
  /content/drive/MyDrive/Polyner/
  ├── input_unc/          # All our prepared files
  ├── Polyner.py
  ├── main_unc.py
  ├── config_unc.json
  ├── model.py
  ├── dataset.py
  └── utils.py
  2. Colab notebook setup:
  # Mount Google Drive
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')

  # Change to project directory
  %cd /content/drive/MyDrive/Polyner

  # Install dependencies
  !pip install tinycudann
  !pip install SimpleITK scikit-image scipy commentjson

  # Run training
  !python main_unc.py
  3. Enable GPU: Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator: GPU (T4/A100)

  Option 2: GPU Computing Cluster (Better for Full Training)

  Transfer files:
  # From your local machine, compress and upload
  tar -czf polyner_unc.tar.gz Polyner/
  scp polyner_unc.tar.gz username@cluster:/path/to/your/workspace/

  # On cluster
  tar -xzf polyner_unc.tar.gz
  cd Polyner/

  Cluster job script (create run_polyner.sh):
  #!/bin/bash
  #SBATCH --job-name=polyner_unc
  #SBATCH --gpus=1
  #SBATCH --mem=16G
  #SBATCH --time=02:00:00

  module load python/3.9
  module load cuda/11.8

  # Install dependencies
  pip install --user tinycudann SimpleITK scikit-image scipy commentjson

  # Run training
  python main_unc.py

  Submit job:
  sbatch run_polyner.sh

  Files You Need to Upload:

  - All files in input_unc/ (our prepared UNC data)
  - Polyner.py, main_unc.py, config_unc.json
  - model.py, dataset.py, utils.py

  Expected Output:

  - Training progress for 3 test cases
  - Reconstructed images in output_unc/
  - Model weights in model_unc/

  The GPU cluster is probably better for the full training since Colab has time limits
  and may disconnect.
